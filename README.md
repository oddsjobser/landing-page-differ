# landing-page-differ
Another landing page, this time experimenting with columns and grids in detail for mobile, tablet and desktop environment.

#column section

At the bottom of the CSS you can find the col grid wihtin the @media only screen sectionwhich specifies the width of the screen 
for the device in percentage.
The reason percentages are used is, that with percentages the screen resolution adjusts itself better to the given statement
than pixles. That is the reason why most webdevs are using it. 

You can adjust the colors in the css main file and add or remove whatever you want through the html or php file up to your choice.
If you are going to use a php environment go for the php file and if you are going for an html environment use the html file.

Hope it will help you.
